XDATA Visualization Widgets
===========================
These visualizations were created by the [Parson's Institute for Information Mapping](http://piim.newschool.edu/) as part of the DARPA XDATA program to demonstrate the type of stand-alone visualization widgets that might compliment a composite dashboard display for a decision-maker/analyst. They are built using [D3](http://d3js.org/) and Javascript. 

Please see the respective READMEs for additional information and installation instructions.
