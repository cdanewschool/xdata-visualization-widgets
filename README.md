xdata-visualization-widgets
===========================
These visualizations were created as part of DARPA's XDATA program to demonstrate the type of standalone visualization widgets that might compliment a composite dashboard display for a descision-maker. They are built using [D3js](http://d3js.org/) and leverage APIs to show the latest available data.

The Bitcoin Transaction Monitor is based on [bitcoinmonitor.com](http://bitcoinmonitor.com/), and streams bitcoin transactions on the Mt. Gox exchange. Data comes from blockchain.info's [Websocket API](http://blockchain.info/api/api_websocket).

The Kiva Field Partner Explorer visualizes Kiva [Field Partners](http://www.kiva.org/partners) as an interactive, zoomable radial pie-chart. Data comes from Kiva's [GetPartners](http://build.kiva.org/api#GET*|partners) API method, and country information comes from Wikimedia's [country code list](https://github.com/wikimedia/limn-data/blob/master/geo/country-codes.json).
